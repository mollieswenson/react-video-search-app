# React Video Search App

This video search app makes calls to the YouTube API and updates the search results as the user types. I created the app as part of a course on React. 

## [Component documentation](React%20video%20search%20app%20documentation.pdf)

This [pdf](React%20video%20search%20app%20documentation.pdf) documents the React components used in a video search app, including property name, type, description, initial state, and state change functions.

## React code

I wrote the code for this app as part of the Udemy course <a href="https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/learn/v4/content">Modern React with Redux</a>.
